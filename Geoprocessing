# Geoprocessing Scipt
# Created by: Jay Gaines
# Created on: 02DEC20
# This script will demonstrate how Python can be used to conduct
# common geoprocessing functins like Clip, Buffer, etc.

# Import Arcpy site package and env class
import arcpy
from arcpy import env

# Set environments
env.workspace = r"C:/Users/Jay/Desktop/GIS4411/GIS4411/L2/GE1/CountyData.gdb"
env.overwriteOutput = True

# Creat variables
cnty = "Counties"
hos = "Hospitals"
clip_hos = "Clip_Hospitals"
dist = "5 Kilometers"

# Clip the hospitals by the counties
arcpy.Clip_analysis(hos, cnty, clip_hos)
print("The " + hos + " feature class has been clipped.")

# Buffer the hospitals
arcpy.Buffer_analysis(hos, clip_hos + "_Buffer", dist, "", "", "ALL")
print("The " + hos + " feature class has been buffered " + dist + ".")

# Earase the counties with the hospital buffer
arcpy.Erase_analysis("counties", "Hospitals_Buffer", "Counties_Erase")
print("The " + cnty + " feature class has been erased.")
